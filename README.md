# Course Overview

Here will be an ordered layout and workflow when creating an ***Umbraco Website***.

I'll order each course file in which you'll have to jump to in order to keep smooth workflow.

I would of structure the course as a step 1, step 2, step 3 structure, but the goal is to master **UmbracoCMS** and the more I learn

I'll update that section file.


Thanks and enjoy
